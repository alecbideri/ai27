## Overview
This project maps the terrifyingly plausible 3-year sprint from unreliable agents to a "God-like" superintelligence. It uses 3D visualizations to represent the increasing complexity and structure of AI models as they evolve from simple "glitchy" wireframes to dense, complex "transcendent" forms.

## Explore the Scenario
Dive deeper into the details, geopolitics, and technical milestones of this race.
